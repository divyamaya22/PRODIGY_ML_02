# PRODIGY_ML_02
Objective
The goal of this project is to use K-means clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchasing behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and services to better meet the needs of each segment.

Key Components
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is cleaned and relevant features (e.g., income, spending score) are selected.
Standardization is applied to ensure features are on the same scale.
Optimal Clustering:

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset by analyzing the inertia (sum of squared distances).
Clustering Algorithm:

K-means clustering groups customers into clusters based on their similarities in purchasing behavior.
Visualization:

A scatter plot is generated to display the clusters, helping to visually interpret the different customer segments.
Output:

The clustered dataset is saved for further analysis and business use.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computation
scikit-learn for clustering and preprocessing
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Features: Includes key attributes like customer income and spending scores.
